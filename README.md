# Prediction-of-Car-Price ðŸš™ ðŸ’°

There are various factors that play a key role in determining the price of a car:
- Power PS
- Year of Registry
- Gear box type
- Vehicle type: example: Limousine, SUV, cabrio, etc.
- Model type
- Kilometres travelled

Using K- Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression, I tried predicting the price of the car from the attributes given in the dataset.
This project has been made using various Machine Learning libraries like:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Random forest regressor from sklearn.ensemble

## RESULT:
RMSE value of 0.43
